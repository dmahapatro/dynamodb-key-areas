Key areas & best practices in AWS DynamoDB

> Assumption: 
> - We have already level set on how NoSQL works.
> - Aware DynamoDB Basics (Table, Items, Attributes, etc)

## Change in Mindset
 - Do not see NoSQL (in this case DynamoDB) from a relational database lens
 - Understand that normalization is not a criteria for DynamoDB
 - Relations will exist in DynamoDB but not in the form of Foreign Key
 - CAP Theorem:
    - Relational databases stresses on Strong consistency model (ACID)
    - DynamoDB stresses on performance and eventual consistency model (BASE)
 - Normalization in RDBMS helps in building more # of Tables.
 - DynamoDB works best on the notion of partitions instead of # of tables
    - Take a good amount of time to understand the rationale of data, how will it be retreived, how will it be written to and from DynamoDB Tables
    - Above analysis will drive the performance and cost of DynamoDB

## Key Concepts to understand
 - [Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.html)
 - [Items](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html)
   - Understand when to use `UpdateItem` vs `PutItem`
   - Understand when to use `BatchWriteItem`
   - Understand the benefits of [Conditional Writes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html#WorkingWithItems.ConditionalUpdate)
 - [Queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Query.html)
 - [Scans](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Scan.html)
 - [Indexes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SecondaryIndexes.html)
   - [Global Secondary Indexes (GSI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GSI.html)
     - An index with a partition key and a sort key that can be different from those on the base table
     - Consumes additional RCU and WCU than the base table. Hence, additional cost
     - GSI can be added to base table after table creation
   - [Local Secondary Indexes (LSI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/LSI.html)
     - An index that has the same partition key as the base table, but a different sort key
     - Uses the RCU and WCU allocated to the base table.
     - LSI can only be added to table during table creation
   - See `Working with Indexes` for additional comparison characteristics
   - Indexes are the key features in DynamoDB and should be used efficiently to get the maximum benefit out of the table
   - Data Modeling decisions also depend on how Indexes will be built in future
 - [Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html)
   - A DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information about changes to items in a DynamoDB table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification to data items in the table
   - Similar to CDC (Change Data Capture) and gets integrated with services like AWS Lambda to do additional operations on change record.
   - Streams are really helpful to build aggregations where item changes are processed via Lambda and the Lambda writes back to DynamoDB with the aggregated value
 - [DAX](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/dax/#:~:text=Amazon%20DynamoDB%20Accelerator%20(DAX)%20is,millions%20of%20requests%20per%20second)
   - Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for Amazon DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10 times performance     improvement—from milliseconds to microseconds—even at millions of requests per second.



## How to model Data in DynamoDB?
 - For new applications, review user stories about activities and objectives. Document the various use cases you identify, and analyze the access patterns that they require.
 - For existing applications, analyze query logs to find out how people are currently using the system and what the key access patterns are.
 - [Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-modeling-nosql.html)
 - [Example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-modeling-nosql-B.html)

## Recommendations/strategies to define access patterns
- Tenets of DynamoDB Data Modeling
  - Understand the user case
  - Identify the access patterns
  - Read/Write workloads
  - Query dimensions and aggregations
  - Data Modeling
  - Using NoSQL design patterns
- Pattern identification process
  -	Data architect and business analyst interview the end users to identify how data will be queried
    -	For new applications, review user stories about activities and objectives.
    -	Document the various use cases you identify, and analyze the access patterns that they require.
    -	For existing applications, analyze query logs to find out how people are currently using the system and what the key access patterns are.
  -	Data Architect discovers the following properties of the access patterns
    -	Data size: Knowing how much data will be stored and requested at one time will help determine the most effective way to partition the data.
    -	Data shape: Instead of reshaping data when a query is processed (as an RDBMS system does), a NoSQL database organizes data so that its shape in the database corresponds with what will be queried. This is a key factor in increasing speed and scalability.
    -	Data velocity: DynamoDB scales by increasing the number of physical partitions that are available to process queries, and by efficiently distributing data across those partitions. Knowing in advance what the peak query loads might help determine how to partition data to best use I/O capacity.
  -	Business Users prioritizes the queries and identify the most common queries.
 -	Types of relationships
    -	One-to-many
    -	Many-to-many
    -	Filtering
    -	Sorting

## What is RCU & WCU?
 - **RCU (Read Capacity Unit):**
   - One read capacity unit represents one strongly consistent read per second, or two eventually consistent reads per second, for an item up to 4 KB in size
 - **WCU (Write Capacity Unit)**
   - One write capacity unit represents one write per second for an item up to 1 KB in size
 - [Reference Document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html#HowItWorks.ProvisionedThroughput.Manual)

## Do I need to care about RCU and WCU?
 - It depends on which mode you want to setup
 - **On-Demand Mode**:
   - When you choose on-demand mode, DynamoDB instantly accommodates your workloads as they ramp up or down to any previously reached traffic level
   - On-demand mode is a good option if any of the following are true:
     - You create new tables with unknown workloads.
     - You have unpredictable application traffic.
     - You prefer the ease of paying for only what you use.
   - [Reference Document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html#HowItWorks.OnDemand)

 - **Provisioned Mode**:
   - If you choose provisioned mode, you specify the number of reads and writes per second that you require for your application
   - Provisioned mode is a good option if any of the following are true:
     - You have predictable application traffic.
     - You run applications whose traffic is consistent or ramps gradually.
     - You can forecast capacity requirements to control costs.
   - [Reference Document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadWriteCapacityMode.html#HowItWorks.ProvisionedThroughput.Manual)

## Security
 - Encryption at Rest
   - Using AWS KMS (Use AWS Owned CMK or AWS managed CMK or Customer Managed CMK)
 - **[VPC Gateway Endpoint for DynamoDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints-ddb.html)**
   - A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. 
   - Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. 
   - Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.
   - Use `aws:sourceVpce` in IAM Policy document `Condition` to specify that connection is only allowed to DynamoDB via a specific VPC endpoint
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "AccessFromSpecificEndpoint",
         "Action": "dynamodb:*",
         "Effect": "Deny",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account-id:table/*",
         "Condition": { 
           "StringNotEquals" : { 
             "aws:sourceVpce": "vpce-11aa22bb" 
            } 
          }
        }  
      ]
   }
   ```
 - **Principal Specific Access**
   - Provide access to the principal provided as a condition
   ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [{
        "Sid": "DenyAccessToDynamoDBOutsidePrincipal",
        "Effect": "Deny",
        "Action": [
            "dynamodb:*"
        ],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account-id:table/*",
        "Condition": {
          "ArnNotLike": {
            "aws:PrincipalARN":"arn:aws:iam::123456789:role/DynamoDBUserRole"
          }
        }
      }]
    }
   ```
 - **Account Specific Access**
   - Provide access to the Pricipal account specified in the policy
   ```json
   {    
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [{
       "Sid": "DenyAccessToDynamoDBOutsidePrincipalAccount",
       "Effect": "Deny",
       "Action": [
         "dynamodb:*"
       ],
       "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account-id:table/*",
       "Condition": {
         "StringNotEquals": {
           "aws:PrincipalAccount": "123456789"
         }
       }
     }]
   }  
   ```

 - **[Fine-Grained Access Control using IAM Policy Conditions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/specifying-conditions.html)**
   - In DynamoDB, you have the option to specify conditions when granting permissions using an IAM policy. For example, you can:
     - Grant permissions to allow users read-only access to certain items and attributes in a table or a secondary index.
     - Grant permissions to allow users write-only access to certain attributes in a table, based upon the identity of that user.
    - Sample Policy Document:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "AllowAccessToOnlyItemsMatchingUserID",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "dynamodb:GetItem",
          "dynamodb:BatchGetItem",
          "dynamodb:Query",
          "dynamodb:PutItem",
          "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
          "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
          "dynamodb:BatchWriteItem"
        ],
        "Resource": [
          "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:123456789012:table/InsurancePolicy"
        ],
        "Condition": {
          "ForAllValues:StringEquals": {
            "dynamodb:LeadingKeys": [
              "${federated_user_id_which_is_the_partition_key_in_table}"
            ],
            "dynamodb:Attributes": [
              "UserId",
              "PolicyType",
              "Claims",
              "Collision",
              "Comprehensive"
            ]
          },
          "StringEqualsIfExists": {
            "dynamodb:Select": "SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }  
  ```
   - `dynamodb:LeadingKeys` – This condition key allows users to access only the items where the partition key value matches their user ID.

   - `dynamodb:Attributes` – This condition key limits access to the specified attributes so that only the actions listed in the permissions policy can return values for these attributes. In addition, the `StringEqualsIfExists` clause ensures that the app must always provide a list of specific attributes to act upon and that the app can't request all attributes.

## Deep Dive Concepts

**VPC Endpoints**

- What are VPC Endpoints?
  
  A VPC endpoint is a connectivity method that allows you to connect your VPC to AWS services without ever leaving the AWS network (ie. no communication via the Open Internet). In AWS, there are three main types of endpoints:
  -	Endpoint Service
    -	Your own application in your VPC
  -	Interface Endpoints
    -	AZ based
    -	Create a network interface (ENIs)
    -	Security is handled via Security Groups
    -	10Gbs/sec
    -	Not highly available by default
    -	Use DNS tables
  -	Gateway Endpoints
    - Gateway that routes traffic to supported AWS services
    -	Associated services (S3 and DynamoDB)
    -	They belong to the VPC
    -	You need to configure the route tables
    -	VPC based
    -	Security is policy based

- High level diagrams
  - **Access to DynamoDB without an endpoint**
  
  ![](images/DynamoDBNoEndpoint.png)
  - **Access to DynamoDB via endpoint**
  
  ![](images/DynamoDBEndpoint.png)
  
  As you can see from the architectural diagrams, the connections from the VPC to the DynamoDB service without an endpoint will go through the open Internet, while the connections using the endpoint will remain inside of the AWS network. Which provides two main benefits for Nationwide: 1) Increased security and 2) Faster performance.
 
 - DynamoDB gateway endpoint considerations for Nationwide  
    -	The DynamoDB gateway endpoint default policy will allow access to any user or service within the VPC
    -	Your own application in your VPC
    -	DynamoDB Streams cannot be accessed through a VPC endpoint
    -	There is no support for cross-region requests
    -	CloudTrail captures the private IP address of the EC2 instance and endpoint ID for any DynamoDB actions
    -	During implementation, any open connections using public IPv4 addresses will get disconnected

## TODOs
 - Add sample code/template
 - Add edge cases scenario

## NEXT STEPS

Involve AWS in Nationwide meetings/conversations regarding the implementation of DynamoDB, so we can better understand the business requirements, identify areas were AWS can bring value and tailor our recommendations to Nationwide.

## FAQ
**How to name tables in DynamoDB per environment if the same AWS Account is used for multiple environments like (dev/test/stage)?**
 
Ideally DynamoDB table should be created per account per region. The table name can be re-used for the same account in a different region. Example:

A table named `InsurancePolicy` can be present in an AWS account in `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) and also be present in the same account in region `us-east-2` (Ohio)

If allowed `dev` and `test` can use a different region than `stage` but keep the same table name.

If multi-region access is not possible then another option will be to use a convention so that the environment name is prefixed/suffixed to the table name for better visibility like `env.domain.table`:

*Example:*  
`dev.nationwide.InsurancePolicy`  => for `dev` environment
`test.nationwide.InsurancePolicy` => for `test` environment

The pipeline taking care of development and test respectively have to prefix the environment while working on their respective table

**Do DynamoDB indexes use additional storage, separate from base table?**

The short answer is YES.
 
When an application writes an item to a table, DynamoDB automatically copies the correct subset of attributes to any local or global secondary indexes in which those attributes should appear. Your AWS account is charged for storage of the item in the base table and also for storage of attributes in any local or global secondary indexes on that table. 

To estimate the storage requirements for a local or global secondary index, you can estimate the average size of an item in the index and then multiply by the number of items in the base table. 
 
If a table contains an item where a particular attribute is not defined, but that attribute is defined as an index sort key, then DynamoDB does not write any data for that item to the index.
